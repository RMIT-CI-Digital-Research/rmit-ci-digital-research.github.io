A repre­ sentative application is visual proximity detection for accident prevention. However, existing deep learning (DL)based proximity detection methods are likely to be inaccurate due to congestion, background clutter, and oc­ clusion in construction sites. Another problem is that most of these methods cannot suffice computing capability, network training efficiency, and performance accuracy at the same time. This study first presents a novel contextguided data augmentation method that addresses the performance loss issue due to object occlusion. This method places new instances on images based on contextual image information rather than randomly erasing images to simulate occlusion circumstances. Next, a light-weight and less-costly DL model named YOLOv4-EFNB0 is formulated for multi-class construction resource detection in real-time. Moreover, this study presents a proactive proximity detection application by integrating YOLOv4-EFNB0 with homography transformation. Based on the experiment, YOLOv4-EFNB0 demonstrates a better object detection outcome when trained on the augmented dataset over the Moving Objects in Construction Sites (MOCS) baseline dataset. This study also conducts a feasibility test for the visual proximity detection application. The results indicate the application has a high accuracy rate and a fast speed, namely, 96.76% in 25 Frames Per Second (FPS), which can facilitate the auto­ mation of safety monitoring and inspection."},"Research/Publication/index":{"title":"Publications","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Check out our publications !"},"Research/Publication/wuCognitiveErgonomicsbasedAugmented2023":{"title":"Cognitive ergonomics-based Augmented Reality application for construction performance","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Wu, S, Hou, L, Chen, H, Zhang, G (Kevin), Zou, Y &amp; Tushar, Q 2023, ‘Cognitive ergonomics-based Augmented Reality application for construction performance’, Automation in Construction, vol. 149, p. 104802.\nonline local pdf\nAbstract\nThere is a growing interest in exploring the use of wearable Augmented Reality (AR) devices to improve the task performance of construction workers. However, user interaction with AR has not been well understood in the current literature, which may result in poor usability, occupational hazards, and low acceptance. To bridge this gap, this study introduced cognitive ergonomics theory to design and develop an AR application for improving the kinaesthetic performance of construction workers conducting onsite assembly tasks. The methodology of this study is three-fold. First, articles in relation to cognitive ergonomics were reviewed to propose a unique cognitive model that reveals the cognitive mechanisms of construction workers, including human information processing, selective attention, and attention resources. Second, the characteristics of existing AR application functions were synthesised to develop a customised and user-friendly wearable AR application that aligns with the identified cognitive mechanisms. Third, a rebar-tying experiment was conducted to validate the developed AR application. The results indicate that the experimenters instructed by the application can complete the task independently without the need to seek after expert assistance; the application has a potential to foster the skill development of construction workers and enhance their kinaesthetic performance; and the proposed cognitive model and the AR development principles are well aligned from the perspective of cognitive ergonomics, which could promote the uptake of wearable AR in the construction industry."},"Research/Publication/wuRealtimeMixedRealitybased2022":{"title":"Real-time mixed reality-based visual warning for construction workforce safety","links":["Team/PhD/Shaoze","Team/PhD/Haosen"],"tags":["VR","AR","BIM"],"content":"Wu, S, Hou, L, Zhang, G (Kevin) &amp; Chen, H 2022, ‘Real-time mixed reality-based visual warning for construction workforce safety’, Automation in Construction, vol. 139, p. 104252.\nAbstract\nSpatial locations of personnel, equipment, and materials are constantly changing as construction projects progress. The dynamic nature of the construction industry affects workers’ performance of identifying hazards. Even though a great deal of effort has been made to improve construction safety, the construction industry still witnesses a high accident rate. In order to complement the existing body of knowledge relating to construction safety, this paper integrates Digital Twin (DT), Deep Learning (DL), and Mixed Reality (MR) technologies into a newly developed real-time visual warning system, which enables construction workers to proactively determine their safety status and avoid accidents. Next, system tests were conducted under three quasi-on-site scenarios, and the feasibility was proven in terms of synchronising construction activities over a large area and visually representing hazard information to its users. These evidenced merits of the development testing scenarios can improve workers’ risk assessment accuracy, reinforce workers’ safety behaviour, and provide a new perspective for construction safety managers to analyse construction safety status."},"Research/Topics/AR":{"title":"Augmented Reality","links":["tags/VR","Team/PhD/Shaoze"],"tags":["VR"],"content":"VR\nRelated Researcher: Shaoze\nAugmented reality (AR) is a technology that overlays digital information, such as images, videos, or data, onto the real world. Unlike virtual reality, which creates a fully immersive digital environment, AR enhances the real-world environment by adding digital elements to it. These digital elements can be seen through devices such as smartphones, tablets, smart glasses, or AR headsets.\nExamples of augmented reality include:\n\nAR Games: Games like Pokémon GO superimpose virtual characters and objects onto the real-world environment seen through a mobile device.\nNavigation: Some AR apps can display navigation information, such as arrows or directions, overlaid on the real world to guide users.\nMaintenance and Repair: AR can provide technicians with detailed instructions superimposed directly onto the equipment they are working on.\nRetail: Virtual fitting rooms allow customers to see how clothes or accessories would look on them without physically trying them on.\n\nOverall, AR enhances the user’s perception of reality by blending digital content seamlessly with the real world."},"Research/Topics/Building-Information-Modelling":{"title":"Building Information Modelling","links":["Team/PhD/Sang"],"tags":[],"content":"Related Researcher: Sang\nBuilding Information Modeling (BIM) is a digital representation of the physical and functional characteristics of a facility.
