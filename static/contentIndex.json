At present, these controls are prescriptive and pre-determined by the design team, rather than responsive to actual building performance. These are further limited by prescribed logic, possess only rudimentary visualizations, and lack broader system integration capabilities. Advances in machine learning, edge analytics, data management systems, and Facility Management-enabled Building Information Models (FM-BIMs) permit a novel approach: cloud-hosted building management. This paper presents an integration technique for mapping the data from a building Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network to an FM-BIM. The sensor data naming convention and time-series analysis strategies integrated into the data structure are discussed and presented, including the use of a 3D nested list to permit time-series data to be mapped to the FM-BIM and readily visualized. The developed approach is presented through a case study describing the scalability of the approach to integrate a building BAS system with a BIM. The resultant data structure and key visualizations are presented to demonstrate the value of this approach, which permits the end-user to select the desired timeframe for visualization and readily step through the spatio-temporal building performance data. ‚Ä¢A linked data approach connects IoT data with BIM.‚Ä¢Acquisition and ingestion, Batch analytics and Integration supports the overall integration.‚Ä¢Time-series navigation of summarized data is facilitated with visual programming languages.‚Ä¢Lab- and full-scale case studies demonstrate the scalability of this approach.\nNotes on paper\nImported on 2023-01-15 7:13 pm\n\n[!quote |2ea8e5] Major Methodology\n\nThis paper presents an integration technique for mapping the data from a building Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network to an FM-BIM.

Unlike virtual reality, which creates a fully immersive digital environment, AR enhances the real-world environment by adding digital elements to it. These digital elements can be seen through devices such as smartphones, tablets, smart glasses, or AR headsets.\nExamples of augmented reality include:\n\nAR Games: Games like Pok√©mon GO superimpose virtual characters and objects onto the real-world environment seen through a mobile device.\nNavigation: Some AR apps can display navigation information, such as arrows or directions, overlaid on the real world to guide users.\nMaintenance and Repair: AR can provide technicians with detailed instructions superimposed directly onto the equipment they are working on.\nRetail: Virtual fitting rooms allow customers to see how clothes or accessories would look on them without physically trying them on.\n\nOverall, AR enhances the user‚Äôs perception of reality by blending digital content seamlessly with the real world."},"Research/Topics/VR":{"title":"Virtual Reality","links":["Team/PhD/Shaoze"],"tags":[],"content":"Related Researcher: Shaoze\nVirtual reality (VR) is a technology that creates an immersive, computer-generated environment that can simulate physical presence in real or imagined worlds. It often involves using a headset or specialized display that covers the eyes and provides a stereoscopic view of the virtual environment. Additionally, VR may include haptic feedback, sound, and motion tracking to enhance the immersion, allowing users to interact with the virtual environment more naturally.\nVR is used in various fields, including gaming, training, education, and therapy, by providing experiences that range from fully immersive games to virtual classrooms and therapy sessions."},"Team/PhD/Hana":{"title":"Hana","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"ü¶ò"},"Team/PhD/Haosen":{"title":"Haosen","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"ü¶ò"},"Team/PhD/Ping":{"title":"Ping","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Who loves keyboard"},"Team/PhD/Sang":{"title":"Sang","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"ü¶ò"},"Team/PhD/Shaoze":{"title":"Shaoze","links":["Research/Topics/VR","Research/Topics/AR"],"tags":[],"content":"ü¶ò\nResearch topic: VR,AR"},"Team/index":{"title":"Team","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Our Research Team"},"index":{"title":"Hello from RMIT!","links":["News/News","Research/Intro-research","Team/PhD/Shaoze","Team/PhD/Haosen","Team/PhD/Sang","Team/PhD/Hana"],"tags":[],"content":"\nTransclude of News\nThe Civil Infrastructure Digital Research Team is dedicated to pioneering advancements in the construction and maintenance of essential public works through cutting-edge digital technology.
